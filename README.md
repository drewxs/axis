# Axis

Simple graphics engine using OpenGL.

There are both low-level and high-level APIs available. The low-level APIs are thin wrappers around OpenGL,
and the high-level APIs (e.g. Mesh) are built on top of the low-level APIs.

To see examples of how to use the engine, see [`engine_tester/src/examples`](engine_tester/src/examples)

The examples go in order: low-level -> high-level

Simple usage [example](engine_tester/src/examples/example_03.rs).
